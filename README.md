With this project, I explored the intriguing relationship between the number of asylum applications and Schengen visa rejection rates. In the past decades, political unrest, humanitarian crises, or sheer poverty have forced many people to seek refuge in Schengen countries. This made me wonder if the increase in asylum applications could be affecting the Schengen visa rejection rates for applicants from these troubled countries. 

My question is: Is there a correlation between the increasing number of asylum applications from a country's citizens and the subsequent rise in rejection rates for Schengen visa applications from that country's residents?

You can find about the answer on the my [blog post](https://ayusuftatli.com/Asylum-Applications-and-Schengen-Visa-Rejection-Rates-Exploring-the-Connection-a053c3050b4e40dc8ccb106bd922aaf6) or right here by clicking on the jupyter notebook file.
